CNN-Based Image Classification using CIFAR-10 | TensorFlow & Keras
ðŸ“š Developed as part of a hands-on deep learning module, this project demonstrates practical application of CNNs for real-world image classification tasks.
A beginner-friendly deep learning project that builds and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 classes including airplane, dog, truck, and more. The notebook includes data visualization, model creation, training, prediction, and performance evaluation.
